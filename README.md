## [Description](#table-of-contents)
The Team Profile Generator application is a handy tool for any software engineering team’s manager, or employee, wanting to capture their team’s key information in one place, for easy reference. The Node.js command-line app takes the user’s input via prompt and generates a simply-styled html webpage capturing the team manager(s), engineer(s), and intern(s) name, employee ID, email address, as well as special info pertaining to each role – Office Number for managers, GitHub link for engineers and school name for interns. After user input is received, new class instances are created based on the employee role and the information is rendered to a bootstrap card and added to the main html rendering code prior to generating the final html file. For the team profile to be generated there is a minimum requirement of at least three employees total. If the user attempts to create a team with fewer than 3 employees, a console.log will warn them on the minimum team requirement and they will be given the prompts to add another employee.
